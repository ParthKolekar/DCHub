# between 1 and 50 inclusive)

## Syslog logging
# Note that syslog has its own logging levels, which may be higher than the one
# you set above.  You may want to read the syslog.conf man page to change the 
# syslog logging level.

# Whether or not to log via syslog

# Syslog host and facility to use.  If sysloghost contians a /, it will be

# hostname and logging will be done via a UDP socket to port 514.

### Unix specific options
# Location of pid file

# Chroot mode
# If 1, will chroot to the directory in which it is located after reading this 
# configuration file, but before reading other files listed above.  You must
# invoke py-dchub as the super user for this to work.  Note that after
# chrooting, py-dchub will not be able to load any additional python modules
# that are not located under the chroot (though ones loaded before the chroot
# will be available)
